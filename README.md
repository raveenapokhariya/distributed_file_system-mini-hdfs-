# distributed_file_system-mini-hdfs-
This project is a mini distributed file system simulation developed in C using socket programming. It demonstrates the working of a NameNode–DataNode architecture similar to Hadoop HDFS.
##Features
Client–Server communication using TCP sockets
File Store, Retrieve, and List operations
Data replication across multiple DataNodes
Metadata management through NameNode
##Technologies Used
C Programming
Winsock2 (Socket Programming)
Distributed Systems Concepts
##Components
Client – Handles user input and communication
NameNode – Manages metadata
DataNodes – Store replicated file blocks
